# AltEnter - Backlog
A backlog of articles I will be posting on my site www.altenter.dev

## How this works?
Its pretty simple.
1. Create an issue
2. Describe the topic, problem or code you would like me to write about

I will then review the issue and prioritise it.

My main focus is on the following but am happy to expand further:
- Life as a developer
- Health and wellbeing
- Dev Skills
- C#, dotnet core, MVC, Vue.js
- Azure, Azure DevOps, Gitlab, Github
- Git
